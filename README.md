A Python AST Visualizer & Static Analyzer that transforms code into interactive graphs. Detect complexity, performance bottlenecks, and code smells with actionable refactoring suggestions.

## Features

### Code Parsing & Visualization Engine
- Parse Python source code into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using Python's `ast` module
- Map AST nodes to interactive visual elements with distinct colors and shapes
- Multiple layout algorithms: hierarchical (dagre), force-directed (fcose), breadth-first
- Detail level control: overview, normal, and detail modes for large codebases
- Auto-simplification for files with many nodes to prevent performance issues
- Zoom, pan, and click-to-inspect node details

### Intelligent Analysis Layer
- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, maintainability index, Halstead metrics
- **Performance Hotspot Detection**: Nested loops, recursion depth, inefficient dictionary/list operations
- **Code Smell Detection**: Long functions, god classes, duplicate code blocks, deep nesting
- **Security Scanning**: SQL injection risks, unsafe deserialization, hardcoded secrets, dangerous function calls

### Optimization Suggestion Engine
- Rule-based refactoring suggestions with specific recommendations
- Auto-fix capability for certain issues (generates unified diff patches)
- Before/after code comparison with estimated performance improvement

### Interactive Learning Mode
- **Code Anatomy**: Highlight execution flow of specific algorithms
- **Beginner Mode**: Display Python documentation when hovering over AST nodes
- **Challenge Mode**: Identify performance issues in provided code samples

|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/analyze` | POST | Full code analysis |
| `/api/ast` | POST | Get AST graph structure |
| `/api/complexity` | POST | Complexity metrics |
| `/api/performance` | POST | Performance hotspots |

## Example Analysis

```python
# Sample code with performance issues
def find_duplicates(arr):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            if i != j and arr[i] == arr[j]:
                if arr[i] not in duplicates:  # O(n) lookup
                    duplicates.append(arr[i])
    return duplicates
```

**Detected Issues:**
- Nested loops: O(n^2) complexity
- List membership check in loop: O(n) per check

**Suggested Fix:**

    for item in arr:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)  # O(n) total complexity
```
